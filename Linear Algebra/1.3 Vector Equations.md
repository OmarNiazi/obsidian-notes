We start with how we define vectors in plane or space. 
### 1.3.1
For vectors in plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ we have the following mathematical definition:

$$ \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix},
\quad x,y \space \in \space \mathbb{R}
$$
And for vectors in space $\mathbb{R}^3$:
$$ \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z
\end{bmatrix},
\quad x,y,z \space \in \space \mathbb{R}
$$
Here, we will not go into detail about the operations that can be performed on vectors. These generally include
- Vector Addition
- Scalar Multiplication
- Vector multiplication (Dot Product, Cross Product)
