We start with how we define vectors in plane or space. 
For vectors in plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ we have the following mathematical definition:

$$ \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix},
\quad x,y \space \in \space \mathbb{R}
$$
And for vectors in space $\mathbb{R}^3$:
$$ \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z
\end{bmatrix},
\quad x,y,z \space \in \space \mathbb{R}
$$
Here, we will not go into detail about the operations that can be performed on vectors. These generally include
- Vector Addition
- Scalar Multiplication
- Vector multiplication (Dot Product, Cross Product)
## 1.3.1 Linear Combinations
Let $\{\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, ..., \vec{v}_p\} \space \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and we have some scalar weights $\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_p\}$, then the **Linear Combination** of the vectors $\{\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, ..., \vec{v}_p\}$ is given by W = $\vec{v}_1x_1 + \space \vec{v}_2x_2 \space + \space...\space +\space \vec{v}_px_p$ , which is also known as the **Vector Equation**.

Before we move forward, it is necessary to describe the **span** of one or more vector. But as that is an expansive topic in itself, we will not define it here. More about span can be found in the note below.
