## Memory Allocation
Memory allocation for a program written in MASM is done in the **.data** section before the main procedure.
It follows the following syntax:
```cpp
.data
	[identifier] Directive/type [Data to be stored]
```
Here:
**Identifier** is not necessary and when it's missing the memory is allocated and the desired data is stored but there is no keyword in the program to access it. So, that data can only be accessed using offsets from other identifiers.
Example:
```cpp
.data
	DB 101
	DD 0FFh
```
