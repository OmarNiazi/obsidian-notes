## Memory Allocation
Memory allocation for a program written in MASM is done in the **.data** section before the main procedure.
It follows the following syntax:
```cpp
.data
	[identifier] Directive/type [Data to be stored]
```
Here:
**Identifier** is not necessary and when it's missing the memory is allocated and the desired data is stored but there is no keyword in the program to access it. So, that data can only be accessed using offsets from other identifiers.
Example:
```cpp
.data
	DB 101
	DD 0FFh
```

## Back Slash '\\'
The back slash '\\'  symbol is used in MASM to break a long line into multiple lines:
```cpp
.data
	v1 \
	DB \
	"Hello", \    ; comment an succeed it
	0FFh, 0AAh
```
An interesting thing about it is that it can only precede a blank space ' ' or a comment before the newline character '\\n'
```cpp
.data
	v1 \
	DB "Hello" \,
	0FFh
```
This is an error as ',' is not an allowed character in between '\\' and '\\n'.
Also, '\\' can't be used inside the **.code** section of the program.

## String Data Allocation
As we know that we can allocate memory and store character arrays inside. Each character requires 1 byte of memory so 'DB' or 'BYTE' are enough but what happens if we use types or directives that allocate space larger than 1 byte.
```cpp
.data
	str1 DW 'AB'
```
Above example code will run just fine because there are 2 bytes allocated and there are exactly 2 characters so in memory they'll show up as:
```
42 41 ; little endian
```
But, consider this example:
```cpp
.data
	str1 DW 'OBSIDIAN'
```
