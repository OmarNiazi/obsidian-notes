# INTRODUCTION
## Preface
C.O.A.L stands for Computer Organization and Assembly Language and it's one of the fundamental courses in the whole degree. In this course we'll touch very briefly on computer organization as it's going to be tackled in the later course of compiler construction. The main focus in this course will be Assembly Language specifically x86 architecture under MASM. Assembly language is the lowest form of human understandable code. All compiled languages are first compiled into assembly code before being assembled into the actual binary form i.e. machine code. In assembly we play at the hardware level moving and editing values in the registers themselves doing all the heavy lifting and in turn realizing what actually happens when a computer computes.

COAL will help us understand
- The hardware computations that take place behind the scenes
- How to write efficient code leveraging as low memory as possible whilst keeping performance the highest
- Has immense applications in 3d shaders and rendering

## Note
These notes don't follow the lecture slides at least in terms of structure. I'll be adding in stuff that I feel like adding (majority of the niche unaddressed stuff).
