The approach for Console input and output used by us is the $ReadConsoleA$ and $WriteConsoleA$ along with the $GetStdHandle$ processes.
Let's first dive deep into the $Invoke$ keyword.

#### Invoke 
It's a directive in MASM that first pushes all the arguments onto the stack from right to left and then calls the process and also handles the return values for the process.
E.g.
```cpp
WriteConsoleA PROTO a1:DWORD, a2:DWORD, a3:DWORD, a4:DWORD, a5:DWORD

.code
main PROC

	invoke WriteConsoleA, eax, addr of array, sizeof array - 1, addr of bytesWritten, 0
```

Here the arguments a5 to a1 are pushed to the stack in order: a5, a4, a3, a2, a1 and then calls the function.

#### Note
When you call Windows API functions using Invoke it returns the value to EAX so it's always modified. Whereas ECX, EDX
