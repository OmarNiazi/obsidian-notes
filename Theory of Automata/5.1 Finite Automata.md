**DEFINITON:** A finite automaton is a collection of three things:

1) A finite set of states, including the **initial/start state** and **final/termination states.**
2) An alphabet $\Sigma$ of possible input letters, from which are formed strings that are to be read one letter at a time.
3) A finite set of **transitions** that tell for each state and for each letter of the input alphabet which state to go to next.
