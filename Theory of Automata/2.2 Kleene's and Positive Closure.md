## Kleene's Closure ($S^*$)

**Definition 1:** Given an alphabet $\Sigma$, we define a language in which any string of letters from $\Sigma$ is a word **including** the null string $\wedge$. We also call this the **closure** of the alphabet $\Sigma$ and its denoted by: $\Sigma^*$

**e.g1.** Consider the alphabets $\Sigma = {x}$ and $L = \{0,1\}$. The Kleene's Closures would be: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Sigma^* &= \{\wedge, x, xx, xxx, xxxx, \ldots \} \\
L^* &= \{\wedge, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, \ldots \} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
- The star with the notation of the alphabet is known as **Kleene's Star**. 
- The ordering of the words (starting from null and then ascendingly ordered) is called the **lexicographic** order.
- Think of Kleene's Star as an operation that makes an infinite language from an alphabet (i.e. infinitely many words)

**Definition 2 (more generalized):** If S is a set of words, then $S^*$ is the set of all finite strings formed by concatenating words from S, where any word may be used as often as we like. Moreover, the null string $\wedge$ is also included.

**e.g2.** If we have $S = \{aa,b\}$, then: $S^*$ would be the null string $\wedge$ plus any word composed of factors of aa and b: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
S^* = \{\wedge, aa, b,aab,baa,bbb,aaaa,aabb,baab,bbaa,bbbb\\
aaaab,aabaa,aabbb,baaaa,baabb,bbaab,bbbaa, ...\} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Factoring and Proof by Constructive Algorithm
To prove that a certain word is in the closure language $S^*$,we can show how it can be written as a concatenate of words from the base set S. Taking the set S from **e.g2**, to show that $aabaab$ belongs to that set, we can show its factors:

- $(aab)(aab)$ or
- $(aa)(b)(aab)$ or
- $(aa)(b)(aa)(b)$ etc..

Since the factors are in the set S, their concatenation is also in $S^*$. When there is only one possibility, then that factoring is **unique**. However, this the above example, this was not the case.

Alright. Let us suppose that we wanted to prove mathematically that this set $S^*$ contains all $x^n$ for $n \neq 1$. If somebody did not believe this and needed convincing, we could proceed as follows:

First, we consider the possibility that there were some powers of the factors of the word(s) of the alphabet that we could not produce by concatenating factors of (xx) and (xxx). Since we can quite easily reach $x^4$ $x^5,$ and even $x^{10}$,  the examples of strings that we cannot produce must be large then. Okay, so we sit down and make a list of all the possible concatenated words from the factors. We reach some absurd amount to about $x^{321}$ but then get stuck. what would be $x^{322}$ ? 

The thing is however, we cannot get stuck here. It's impossible to. Why? Because we have just established a mathematical proof through our repetitions to construct new words from the factors. It is a proof based on showing that something exists (the factoring) because we can describe how to create it. This is called **proof by constructive algorithm**.

## Positive Closure ($S^+$)
The **positive closure** of a set $S$, denoted $S^+$, is similar to Kleene’s Star, except it does **not** include the null string $\wedge$.  

Formally:  
$$
S^+ = S \cdot S^* = \{ w_1 w_2 \ldots w_n \mid n \geq 1, w_i \in S \}
$$

**Example:**  
If $S = \{a\}$, then:  
- $S^* = \{\wedge, a, aa, aaa, aaaa, \ldots\}$  
- $S^+ = \{a, aa, aaa, aaaa, \ldots\}$  

So $S^+ = S^* - \{\wedge\}$.
