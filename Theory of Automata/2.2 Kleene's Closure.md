**Definition 1:** Given an alphabet $\Sigma$, we define a language in which any string of letters from $\Sigma$ is a word **including** the null string $\wedge$. We also call this the **closure** of the alphabet $\Sigma$ and its denoted by: $\Sigma^*$

**e.g1.** Consider the alphabets $\Sigma = {x}$ and $L = \{0,1\}$. The Kleene's Closures would be: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Sigma^* &= \{\wedge, x, xx, xxx, xxxx, \ldots \} \\
L^* &= \{\wedge, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, \ldots \} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
- The star with the notation of the alphabet is known as **Kleene's Star**. 
- The ordering of the words (starting from null and then ascendingly ordered) is called the **lexicographic** order.
- Think of Kleene's Star as an operation that makes an infinite language from an alphabet (i.e. infinitely many words)

**Definition 2 (more generalized):** If S is a set of words, then $S^*$ is the set of all finite strings formed by concatenating words from S, where any word may be used as often as we like. Moreover, the null string $\wedge$ is also included.

**e.g2.** If we have $S = \{aa,b\}$, then: $S^*$ would be the null string $\wedge$ plus any word composed of factors of aa and b: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
S^* = \{\wedge, aa, b,aab,baa,bbb,aaaa,aabb,baab,bbaa,bbbb\\
aaaab,aabaa,aabbb,baaaa,baabb,bbaab,bbbaa, ...\} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Factoring and Proof by Constructive Algorithm
To prove that a certain word is in the closure language $S^*$,we can show how it can be written as a concatenate of words from the base set S. Taking the set S from **e.g2.**, to show that $aabaab$ belongs to that set, we can show its factors:
- $(aab)(aab)$ or
- $(aa)(b)(aab)$ or
- $(aa)(b)(aa)(b)$ etc..
Since the factors are in the set S, their concatenation is also in $S^*$.
