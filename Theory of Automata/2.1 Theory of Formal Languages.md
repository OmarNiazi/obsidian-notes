In plain English, we distinguish 3 different entities:

1) Letters
2) Words
3) Sentences

A group of letters make a words, a group of which makes sentences.

However, not all collections of letters form valid words, and not all collections of words form valid sentences. Therefore we need a strong theoretical foundation from which our language is built.

To construct a general **theory of formal languages**, we need to have the definition of a **language structure**, in which the decision of whether a given string of units constitutes a valid larger unit is not a matter of guesswork, but clear and explicit rules.

In this model, we will consider language as symbols with *formal*
(i.e. the form of the string, not the meaning. This is important as most of our sets might look like gibberish) rules.

### Basic Definitions:
- A finite, non-empty set of symbols (letters) is called an **alphabet**, denoted by the letter $\Sigma$ (Sigma).
- A **string** is a concatenation of finite symbols from the alphabet.
e.g. if $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$ then a string would be any combination of these, such as $aaaaa, bbbb, abab$
- A **word** is a string that belongs to some language.
