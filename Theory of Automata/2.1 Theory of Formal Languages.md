In plain English, we distinguish 3 different entities:

1) Letters
2) Words
3) Sentences

A group of letters make a words, a group of which makes sentences.

However, not all collections of letters form valid words, and not all collections of words form valid sentences. Therefore we need a strong theoretical foundation from which our language is built.

To construct a general **theory of formal languages**, we need to have the definition of a **language structure**, in which the decision of whether a given string of units constitutes a valid larger unit is not a matter of guesswork, but clear and explicit rules.

In this model, we will consider language as symbols with *formal*
(i.e. the form of the string as in what constitutes a valid string format, not the meaning. This is important as most of our sets might look like gibberish) rules.

## Basic Definitions:
- A finite, non-empty set of symbols (letters) is called an **alphabet**, denoted by the letter $\Sigma$ (Sigma).
- A **string** is a concatenation of finite symbols from the alphabet.
e.g. if $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$ then a string would be any combination of these, such as $aaaaa, bbbb, abab$
- A **word** is a string that belongs to some language. 
e.g. if $\Sigma = \{x\}$ and a language L is defined as $L = \{x^n: n = 1,2,3 ...\}$, then $x, xx, xxx ...$ are all words
##### - Empty String (Null String):
- A string can also have no letters, this is called the **empty string** or **null string**, denoted by the symbol Λ.
- If Λ is a word in a language, it represents a word with zero letters.
- Important note: Λ is **not** considered a symbol of any alphabet.
- Example: If L = {x, xx, xxx …}, then Λ ∉ L unless explicitly added.
- The language with no words at all is denoted by ∅ (null set).  
    - In ∅, even Λ is not present since there are no words at all.

##### - Concatenation:
- Concatenation means writing two strings side by side to form a longer string.
- If $a = xxx$ and $b = xx$, then $ab = xxxxx$.
- Generally, if $a = x^n$ and $b = x^m$, then $ab = x^{n+m}$.
- Example: If $L = \{x, xxx, xxxxx ...\}$ then $a=xxx$ and $b=xxxxx$ are words in L, but $ab=xxxxxxxx$ is **not** in L.
- Therefore, concatenation does not always produce a word in the same language.

---
##### Length:
- The **length** of a string is the number of symbols in it.  
Notation: $|w|$ = length of string $w$.
- Examples:
  - If $a = xxxx$, then $|a| = 4$.
  - If $c = 428$, then $|c| = 3$.
  - $|\Lambda| = 0$.
- In general, if $|w| = 0$, then $w = \Lambda$.

---
### Reverse:
- The **reverse** of a string $w$ is the same sequence of symbols but in opposite order.
- Examples:
  - reverse(xxx) = xxx
  - reverse(145) = 541
- Important: The reverse of a word may not belong to the same language.  
  e.g. $140 \in L$, but reverse(140) = 041 ∉ L.

---
### Palindrome:
- A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
- Defined over Σ = {a, b}:
  - PALINDROME = {Λ, a, b, aa, bb, aaa, aba, bab, bbb, …}
- Examples:
  - abba ∈ PALINDROME since reverse(abba) = abba.
  - aaaba ∉ PALINDROME since reverse(aaaba) = abaaa ≠ aaaba.

---
### Kleene Closure:
- For an alphabet Σ, the **Kleene Closure** (Σ*) is the set of all finite strings that can be formed using letters from Σ, including Λ.
- Examples:
  - If Σ = {x}, then Σ* = {Λ, x, xx, xxx, …}
  - If Σ = {0,1}, then Σ* = {Λ, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, …}
- The star (*) operator makes an **infinite set of words**.

---
### Lexicographic Order:
- The natural ordering of words:
  - First by **shortest length**.
  - Then alphabetically within words of the same length.
- Example for Σ = {a, b}:  
  Λ, a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, aab, …

---
### Positive Closure:
- Defined as Σ⁺, meaning all strings from Σ except Λ.
- In other words: Σ⁺ = Σ* – {Λ}.
- Example:  
  If Σ = {x}, then Σ⁺ = {x, xx, xxx, …}
