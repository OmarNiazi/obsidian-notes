In plain English, we distinguish 3 different entities:

1) Letters
2) Words
3) Sentences

A group of letters make a words, a group of which makes sentences.

However, not all collections of letters form valid words, and not all collections of words form valid sentences. Therefore we need a strong theoretical foundation from which our language is built.

To construct a general **theory of formal languages**, we need to have the definition of a **language structure**, in which the decision of whether a given string of units constitutes a valid larger unit is not a matter of guesswork, but clear and explicit rules.

In this model, we will consider language as symbols with *formal*
(i.e. the form of the string as in what constitutes a valid string format, not the meaning. This is important as most of our sets might look like gibberish) rules.

## Basic Definitions:
- A finite, non-empty set of symbols (letters) is called an **alphabet**, denoted by the letter $\Sigma$ (Sigma).
- A **string** is a concatenation of finite symbols from the alphabet.
	-  e.g. if $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$ then a string would be any combination of these, such as $aaaaa, bbbb, abab$
- A **word** is a string that belongs to some language. 
	- e.g. if $\Sigma = \{x\}$ and a language L is defined as $L = \{x^n: n = 1,2,3 ...\}$, then $x, xx, xxx ...$ are all words
##### - Empty String (Null String):
- A string can also have no letters, this is called the **empty string** or **null string**, denoted by the symbol Λ.
- If Λ is a word in a language, it represents a word with zero letters.
- Important note: Λ is **not** considered a symbol of any alphabet.
	- Example: If L = {x, xx, xxx …}, then Λ ∉ L unless explicitly added.
- The language with no words at all is denoted by ∅ (null set).  
    - In ∅, even Λ is not present since there are no words at all.
##### - Concatenation:
- Concatenation means writing two strings side by side to form a longer string.
- If $a = xxx$ and $b = xx$, then $ab = xxxxx$.
- Generally, if $a = x^n$ and $b = x^m$, then $ab = x^{n+m}$.
	- Example: If $L = \{x, xxx, xxxxx ...\}$ then $a=xxx$ and $b=xxxxx$ are words in L, but $ab=xxxxxxxx$ is **not** in L.
- Therefore, concatenation does not always produce a word in the same language.
##### - Length:
- The **length** of a string is the number of symbols in it.  
	- Notation: $|w|$ = length of string $w$.
- Examples:
  - If $a = xxxx$, then $|a| = 4$.
  - If $c = 428$, then $|c| = 3$.
  - $|\Lambda| = 0$.
- In general, if $|w| = 0$, then $w = \Lambda$.
