Regular expressions are symbols that allow us to define a language without using complicated and sometimes verbose symbols and notations.

The main notations we will use to generate regular expressions will be the [[2.2 Kleene's and Positive Closure|two closures we have already studied]]. We know the Kleene's closure denotes an infinite set starting with a null and a Positive Closure simply doesn't have the null string. 

### Definition
The following rules define the language associated with any regular expression.
1) **Rule 1:** The language associated with the regular expression that is just a single letter is that one-letter word alone, and the language associated with $\wedge$ is just $\{\wedge\}$, a one-word language.
2)
