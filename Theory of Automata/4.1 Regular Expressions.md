Regular expressions are symbols that allow us to define a language without using complicated and sometimes verbose symbols and notations.

The main notations we will use to generate regular expressions will be the [[2.2 Kleene's and Positive Closure|two closures we have already studied]]. We know the Kleene's closure denotes an infinite set starting with a null and a Positive Closure simply doesn't have the null string. Below will be some examples of regular expressions for pre-defined sets.
### Examples of Regular Expressions

**e.g1.** Let $L = \{aa, aba, abba ,abbba, abbbba ...\}$
- for this example, the regular expression would be $ab^*a$  which means a string starting with a, having an infinite amount of bs and then ending with an a as well.

**e.g2.**  $a^*b^* \ne \(ab\)$
