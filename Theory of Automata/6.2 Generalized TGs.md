  
**DEFINITION:** A generalized transition graph is a collection of three things:

1. A finite set of states, of which at least one is a **start state** and some (maybe none) are **final states**.
2. An alphabet $\Sigma$ of input letters.
3. Directed edges connecting some pairs of states, each labeled with a **regular expression**.

**The big difference:** Instead of labeling edges with specific strings, we label them with entire regular expressions.

#### Why GTGs Matter
GTGs represent the ultimate generalization of our machine concept. Instead of saying "read exactly this string," we can say "read any string that matches this pattern."

**Example:** An edge labeled $(ba + a)^*$ means you can traverse it by reading any string generated by that regular expression - "ba", "a", "baa", "aba", "", etc.

**Key insight:** There's a beautiful equivalence between Kleene star closure in regular expressions and loops in transition graphs. A loop that you can traverse zero or more times is essentially the same as a starred expression where you can choose the $\Lambda$ option.

#### The Power of Regular Expression Labels

Consider recognizing "all strings without a double b." In a regular TG, this might require multiple states and careful edge management. In a GTG, you might handle most of the complexity in the regular expression on a single edge.
This makes GTGs incredibly powerful for compact representation of complex languages, though they can be harder to trace through by hand.

#### Non-determinism in Full Force
GTGs exhibit non-determinism in two ways:
1. **Path choice:** Multiple ways to traverse the machine
2. **Pattern matching:** Multiple ways a string might match a regular expression
This double layer of non-determinism makes GTGs very flexible but also means that acceptance requires even more careful consideration of "does there exist some way..."

#### The Hierarchy

Understanding the relationship:
- **FA ⊆ TG ⊆ GTG**
- Every FA is a TG (just restrict edge labels to single letters)
- Every TG is a GTG (just treat string labels as trivial regular expressions)
- The reverse inclusions are not true

**NOTE:** The real power of these concepts becomes apparent when you start converting between different representations and proving language equivalences. Practice with concrete examples is essential - the theory only makes sense when you can trace through actual machines with actual inputs.
