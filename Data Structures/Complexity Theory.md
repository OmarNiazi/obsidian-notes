Here we start our journey towards actually becoming efficient coders. 
A computer program in the most basic sense is just an algorithm, with data. 
There may be different algorithms to deal with a single problem. Some are better that others. How do we make a judgment on that? The following are the three major criteria for an efficient algorithm, listed from most important to least.
1. **Time Complexity**: How much time the algorithm takes to complete a task as the input size grows. 
2.
