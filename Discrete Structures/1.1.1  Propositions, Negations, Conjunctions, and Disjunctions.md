# Basics of Propositional Logic  

## Propositions  
**Definition**: A proposition is a declarative statement that is either **true or false** (but not both).  
**Notation**: We usually use variables like **p, q, r** to represent propositions.  

### Examples  
Let’s make this less abstract and look at some actual propositions:  
- p: "2 + 2 = 4" → true (basic math)  
- q: "5 is less than 2" → false (nope)  
- r: "Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan" → true  

Other slightly trickier ones:  
- "x + 1 = 2, where x = 1" → true  
- "x + 1 = 2, where x = 5" → false  

### Not Propositions  
Some things might look like propositions but don’t qualify:  
- "What time is it?" → a question, not true or false.  
- "Shut the door!" → a command, not true/false.  
- "x + 1 = 2" (without giving x) → this is called an **open statement**. Since we don’t know the value of x, we can’t assign it a truth value, so it’s not a proposition.

## Logical Connectives (Intro)  

**Definition**: Logical connectives are symbols used to combine simple propositions into more complex ones (called *compound propositions*).

### Negation (¬p)  
- **Formal**: Negation flips the truth value of a proposition. If p is true, ¬p is false, and vice versa.  
- **Example**: If p = "It is raining", then ¬p = "It is not raining". Simple truth-flip.

### Conjunction (p ∧ q)  
- **Formal**: Conjunction means "p and q". It is true only when both propositions are true.  
- **Example**: "I will eat pizza AND drink Coke". If one of them doesn’t happen, the whole statement falls apart.  

---

### Disjunction (p ∨ q)  
- **Formal**: Disjunction means "p or q". It is true if at least one proposition is true.  
- **Example**: "I will eat pizza OR I will eat burgers". Even if just one happens, the statement is satisfied.  

---

### Implication (p → q)  
- **Formal**: Implication represents "if p, then q". It is false only when p is true but q is false.  
- **Example**: "If it rains, then the ground gets wet". If it rains and somehow the ground stays dry, the implication fails.  

---

### Biconditional (p ↔ q)  
- **Formal**: Biconditional means "p if and only if q". It is true when both have the same truth value.  
- **Example**: "You can enter the club if and only if you’re on the list". If one side doesn’t match the other, the whole statement is false.  

---

### Why These Matter  
These connectives are like the **grammar of logic**. They let us take small pieces (p, q, r) and stitch them into larger, more complex statements, like:  
- (p ∧ q) → r  
- (¬p ∨ q)

## Negation  

**Definition**: Negation is a logical operation that flips the truth value of a proposition.  
- If a statement is true, its negation is false.  
- If a statement is false, its negation is true.  

**Alternative phrasing**: The symbol for negation (¬p) can also be read as:  
- "It is not the case that p".  

**Examples**:  
1. p: "The sky is blue" → true  
   ¬p: "The sky is not blue" → false  

2. q: "5 > 10" → false  
   ¬q: "It is not the case that 5 > 10" → true  

3. r: "Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan" → true  
   ¬r: "It is not the case that Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan" → false  

### Truth Table for Negation  

| $p$ | $\neg p$ |
| --- | -------- |
| T   | F        |
| F   | T        |
