# Basics of Propositional Logic  

## Propositions  
- **Definition**: A proposition is a declarative statement that is **either true or false** (but not both).  
- **Notation**: We usually use variables like **p, q, r** to represent propositions.  

### Examples of Propositions  
- "2 + 2 = 4" → **True**  
- "Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan" → **True**  
- "5 is less than 2" → **False**  
- "x + 1 = 2, where x = 1" → **True**  
- "x + 1 = 2, where x = 5" → **False**  

### Non-Examples  
- "What time is it?" → **Not a proposition** (question, not declarative)  
- "Shut the door!" → **Not a proposition** (command, not true/false)  
- "x + 1 = 2" (without assigning x) → **Not a proposition** (open statement, truth value undefined)
