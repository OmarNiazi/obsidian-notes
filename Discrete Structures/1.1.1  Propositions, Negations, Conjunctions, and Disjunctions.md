# Basics of Propositional Logic  

## Propositions  
- **Definition**: A proposition is a declarative statement that is **either true or false** (but not both).  
- **Notation**: We usually use variables like **p, q, r** to represent propositions.  

### Examples of Propositions  
- ***p***: "2 + 2 = 4" **(True)**  
- ***q***: "5 is less than 2" **(False)**  
- ***r***: "Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan" **(True)**  

### Other Examples  
- "x + 1 = 2, where x = 1" → **True**  
- "x + 1 = 2, where x = 5" → **False**  

### Non-Examples (Not Propositions)  
- "What time is it?" **(Question)**  
- "Shut the door!" **(Command)**  
- "x + 1 = 2" **(open statement, truth value undefined)**
