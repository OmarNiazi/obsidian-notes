## Implication  

**Definition**:  
An implication is a conditional statement connecting two propositions. It has the form:  

- Symbol: **p → q**  
- Read as:  
  - "If p, then q", or  
  - "p implies q"  

Here, **p** is called the *hypothesis* (or antecedent), and **q** is the *conclusion* (or consequent).

**How to Think About It**:  
- We are saying that **q is true whenever p is true**.  
- If the condition (p) holds, then the consequence (q) must also hold.  
- If the condition doesn’t hold (p is false), the implication makes **no promises** about q. That’s the part that often feels unintuitive at first.
