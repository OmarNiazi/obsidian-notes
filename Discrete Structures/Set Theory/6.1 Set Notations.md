Let A and B be two sets. Then,
A is a **subset** of B if all elements of A appear in B
	$A \subsetneq B$
	A can have as many elements as B or less, and they all appear in B
	$A = \{1,2\},  B = \{1,2,3\}$
	$A = \{1,2,3\}, B = \{1,2,3\}$

$A$ is a $Proper Subset$ of $B$ if $A$ strictly has less elements than $B$, and they all exist in $B$.
	$A \subset B$
	$A = \{1,2,3\}, B = \{1,2,3\}$
